        The Ministry of Defense plays a huge role in protecting our nation and provides the military forces needed to
        deter war and ensure our nation's security. We assist the Potentate in exercising his powers and everything
        inherent to national defense and relations with the Armed Forces. We fight for a world where people can live in freedom and security.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Join the Military!</h3>

        At the age of 17 Gilaïan inhabitants receive a letter that they are obligated to serve in the military for at
        least one year. This can be in either the army or navy (For joining the Air force more training is required).
        In times of need, people from 17 to 21 can be drafted into the military, see "Wet voor Invoering Dienstplicht
        onder Jongeren" on the <a href=”laws.html”> subpage 'laws.'</a> Of course, the military forces do not just exist
        out of people between the range of 17 and 21 years old. Professional soldiers work full time keeping our country
        safe! <br><br>

        You can always join the military forces, even of you are not between the ages of 17 and 21 years old.
        This can simply be done by <a href="mailto: gilaiemodgov@gmail.com">sending an email</a>
        or via the button below. When you enlist, you will follow the same course as all drafted civilians. In this way
        you
        will be led and supported to become perfectly trained for the armed forces. <br><br>

        <h3>Protection of His Majesty the <abbr title="Dutch: Vorst">Potentate</abbr> of Gilaïe</h3>

        Our task as defence is to protect the nation, the people and especially the Potentate. When the <abbr
            title="Dutch: Vorst">Potentate</abbr> is out
        in public during special occasions, for example, the national days like Proclamation Day and Day of the Ruler,
        he will be protected by a small group of highly trained armed forces.

        <h4>Special occasions</h4>

        On the Day of the Ruler, we start with an open ceremony in the church of Kirkja. After that, we will march over
        the island behind the carriage with our leader in it. This march towards Hattarvík is accompanied by armed
        forces staying in close proximity to the carriage to prevent any worst-case scenario. When arrived at the main
        hall located in Hattarvík, the <abbr title="Dutch: Vorst">Potentate</abbr> is guided into the hall for the
        closed meeting. <br> <br>

        On the 10th of June, on Proclamation Day, the <abbr title="Dutch: Vorst">Potentate</abbr> appears on the balcony
        of the city Hall in Hattarvík to
        celebrate the independence of the principality of Gilaïe. He will speak the yearly speech in which he speaks to
        the big crowd in front of him about the love and the unity of the nation. This event is closed on all sides by
        security and fences to protect the people and the <abbr title="Dutch: Vorst">Potentate</abbr> at all costs. Each
        visitor is checked in advance in
        to make sure this important day is not interrupted in any way. It is not necessary to protect our supreme leader
        in large amounts since he is the most loved amongst the people from Gilaïe.

        <h4>Everyday operations</h4>

        When our ruler is not out in public, the <abbr title="Dutch: Vorst">Potentate</abbr> is free to move over the
        island. There is no need to protect
        him in his spare time and he can move freely over the island. The <abbr title="Dutch: Vorst">Potentate</abbr>
        always can ask for private guards,
        which will protect him undercover when he feels the need for it. This protection can come from near or watchmen
        from further away. This might cause him to feel freer in his spare time. When the situation escalates and the
        danger is rising, the same armed group as on national holidays will protect him. During international missions
        or occasional stays abroad, the <abbr title="Dutch: Vorst">Potentate</abbr> receives the exact treatment.
